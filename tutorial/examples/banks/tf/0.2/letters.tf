Everything
about
us
everything
around
us
everything
we
know
and
can
know
of
is
composed
ultimately
of
patterns
of
nothing
thatâ€™s
the
bottom
line
the
final
truth
So
where
we
find
we
have
any
control
over
those
patterns
why
not
make
the
most
elegant
ones
the
most
enjoyable
and
good
ones
in
our
own
terms
Besides
it
left
the
humans
in
the
Culture
free
to
take
care
of
the
things
that
really
mattered
in
life
such
as
sports
games
romance
studying
dead
languages
barbarian
societies
and
impossible
problems
and
climbing
high
mountains
without
the
aid
of
a
safety
harness
